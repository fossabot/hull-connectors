# Website connector

The website connector makes it easy to send your website data to Hull and any connected tool using the Hull.js library.
It allows to track the website traffic and merge it with data coming from other services.

## Installation

This connector integrates with a website through a single HTML tag which then lets you control it's behavior entirely from the Settings section.

1. First, go to the settings pane and whitelist the domains you would like to authorize and get data from.
  > Note 1: You can use the wildcard entry to whitelist all subdomains of specific domain.<br />
  > **Example:** whitelisting `*.website.com` will whitelist `en.website.com`, `de.website.com`, `fr.website.com`... etc.

  > Note 2: By default connector expects HTTPS to be available on whitelisted domains, if you want to allow non-https website to load Hull.js you need to explicitly add `http://` protocol in front of the domain in the whitelist.

2. Then, copy the HTML tag show below the whitelist and paste it in the `<head>` section of your website.
  You may need to refer to your website system to know how to embed the code, but below we provide guides for common systems.

  > Note: If you are using Google Tag Manager, make sure to checkout the Guide on [how to set up Hull.js with Google Tag Manager](https://www.hull.io/docs/guides/getting-started/setting-up-hull-js-with-google-tag-manager/

3. That's it! The connector will start now capturing your website traffic. By default it will track every page view.
  See below how to adjust every part of the connector.

## Settings reference

Connector settings are split into three main sections:

- Tracking
- Scripts
- Aliasing

### Tracking

Tracking of web traffic is performed by low level library called Hull.js. To learn more about how it works, checkout the [Hull.js
 Guide](https://www.hull.io/docs/guides/getting-started/getting-started-hull-js/).

By default this connector provides automatic tracking of page view events and default identity resolution.

Automatic Page tracking can be disabled here and replaced by your own custom tracking logic through additional javascript code deployed to the website. You can optionally use Scripts section below to embed custom code.

Further customization capabilities are described at length in the [Hull.js reference](https://www.hull.io/docs/reference/hull_js/).

### Scripts

To make the customization easier the connector comes with support for `Embedded Script` and `External Scripts`, allowing you to quickly and easily deploy additional javascript code.

- `External Scripts` let you load additional code libraries without having to edit your website. Hull will load them asynchronously, without blocking the page. This is also the recommended way of deploying client-side parts of other connectors to integrate with external services not only on the back-end but also on the front-end.
- `Embedded Script` let you quickly deploy code to the website Hull connector is installed in. This allows to adjust the tracking plan without constant updates to the website.

#### Client-side connectors

Some connector for specific services such as Intercom can also have a Client-side component that you should inject using the Embedded Scripts feature, to establish additional connection between Hull and the service. Here is a list of the supported Client-side connectors:

| connector | url |
| --- | --- |
| intercom | https://hull-intercom.herokuapp.com/ship.js |

### Aliasing

The connector comes with packaged support for capturing and storing identifiers from frontend libraries used in your website.
These identifiers can be used to merge anonymous website traffic with data coming from 3rd party services or other sources.
Connector will pick the identifier when found in the browser and store it as an anonymous id on the Hull User profile.

This is a list of currently supported identifiers:
- Hubspot UTK ID - Hubspot Visitor ID which can be resolved into Hubspot Contact ID, requires configuring Hubspot connector. Alias Hull User with `hubspot-utk` prefix.
- Intercom Visitor ID - Intercom visitor ID. Alias Hull User with `intercom` prefix.
- Facebook Pixel ID - identifier generated by Facebook Pixel to distinguish between users. Alias Hull User with `fbp` prefix.
- Google Analytics ID - unique identifier generated by Google Analytics. Alias Hull User with `ga` prefix.

## General notes

**Whitelist reference**

The domain whitelist controls Content Security Policy header used for the Hull.js library.
Check [header reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) for all possible configuration options.

**Caching**

Due to performance reasons the configuration of the Hull Website tag is cached for 5 minutes, so you may need to wait for your changes to take effect. This affects all settings of the connector. On your own browser you can clean the cache or hot-reload the page to see the changes immediately.

**Deactivation**

When website connector is deactivated the Hull.js snippet won't run at all. No tracking will be performed and none of the additional scripts will be loaded to the page.

## Best practices

Deploying javascript code to a website when using Hull connector is easy, but it's important to keep in mind some best practises to avoid problems with front-end code.

**Wrap code in self-executing functions**

It's very easy to pollute website global namespace which leads to risk of overwriting existing variables and function names.
We recommend you wrap every custom code deployed to website with self-executing or self-invoking function.

```js
// BAD: not wrapped code, pollutes global namespace
var foo = 'Hello';

// GOOD: wrapped function, no risk of collision
(function() {
  var foo = 'Hello';
})();
```
