## Features

The <%connector_name%> Connector allows you to receive data from external systems, write Javascript to transform the received data to update users and accounts in Hull, as well as emit events in Hull to track behavioral data.

Available actions that can be coded:
 - `create users/accounts`
 - `create user/account attributes`
 - `update user/account attributes`
 - `create user events`
 - `link users to accounts`

To make the Connector even more powerful, you can use the `request` library [https://github.com/request/request](https://github.com/request/request) to call external services.
